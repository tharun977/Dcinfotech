                    <h3>About Messi</h3>
                    <p class="lead">Argentina native Lionel Messi has established records for goals scored and won individual awards en route to worldwide recognition as one of the best players in soccer.</p>
                    <p class="lead">Born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina, soccer player Lionel Messi moved to Spain at the age of 13, after the FC Barcelona club agreed to pay for hormone-deficiency treatments. Messi became a star in his new country, leading his club to championships. In 2012, he set a record for most goals in a calendar year, and in 2016, he was named Europe's Ballon d'Or winner for the fifth time.</p>
                    <p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>For the world of soccer, Messi is a treasure because he is a role model for children around the world. Messi will be the player to win the most Ballons d'Or in history. He will win five, six, seven. He is incomparable. He's in a different league.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">Lionel Messi, born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina, is widely regarded as one of the greatest soccer players of all time. His journey from a young boy with a growth hormone deficiency to a global soccer icon is nothing short of extraordinary. Messi joined FC Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, at the age of 13, and quickly rose through the ranks to make his first-team debut at 17.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Messi's early career was marked by his incredible skill and vision on the field, which earned him comparisons to soccer legends like Diego Maradona. He played a pivotal role in Barcelona's success, leading the team to numerous titles and setting multiple records. His achievements include winning multiple Ballon d'Or awards and breaking records for goals scored in a calendar year.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">In addition to his success with Barcelona, Messi has made significant contributions to the Argentina national team. He led Argentina to victory in the 2021 Copa América and played a crucial role in their triumph at the 2022 FIFA World Cup. His ability to perform in high-pressure situations and his dedication to the sport have cemented his status as one of the greatest players of all time.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Messi eventually grew to 5 feet and 7 inches, and with his short stature, speed, and relentless attacking style, he drew comparisons to another famous Argentinean footballer: Diego Maradona. Messi steered Barcelona to a wealth of success, most notably in 2009, when the left-footer's team captured the Champions League, La Liga, and Spanish Super Cup titles. That same year, after two consecutive runner-up finishes, he took home his first FIFA "World Player of the Year" honor/Ballon d'Or award.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Even the great Maradona gushed about his fellow countryman. "I see him as very similar to me," the retired player told the BBC. "He's a leader and is offering lessons in beautiful football. He has something different than any other player in the world."</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Amazingly, the diminutive soccer wizard continued to improve, discovering new ways to elude defenders while leading Barcelona to La Liga and Spanish Super Cup championships in 2010 and 2011, as well as the '11 Champions League title.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Messi embarked on an all-out assault on the record books in 2012. He became the first player to score five goals in a Champions League match in early March, and a few weeks later he surpassed Cesar Rodriguez's club-record 232 goals to become Barcelona's all-time leading scorer. By the end of 2012, Messi had accumulated an astounding 91 goals in club and international play, eclipsing the 85 netted in a single calendar year by Gerd Muller in 1972. Fittingly, he broke another record when he was named the FIFA Ballon d'Or winner for the fourth time in January 2013.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">The soccer great came back to earth somewhat that year due to the persistence of hamstring injuries, but he regained his record-breaking form by becoming the all-time leading scorer in La Liga and Champions League play in late 2014. After helping Barcelona achieve a historic second treble in 2015, he was honored with his fifth FIFA Ballon d'Or trophy.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Messi has continued to add to his illustrious career with PSG and Inter Miami, securing more titles and awards. In 2023, he helped Inter Miami win the Leagues Cup, further solidifying his legacy as one of the greatest players of all time.</p>
